# Minecraft Island Generator Plugin

## Create your custom islands in every world!
Recommended to use in void worlds, but can also be used in others.

On every island a chest will be spawned, which when clicked, will drop loot.
The content multiplier can be modified via the config.yml.

Should the server overload, try setting the "tickBuffer" in the config file to a higher number, to give the server the oppertunity to relax.

## Commands
`/mx-ig reload`
Reloads the plugin.

`/mx-ig generate`
Generates the islands within <x>*<x>*<x> cube defined by "spawnRadius" in the config file.
This will not override existing Islands.
You can increase "spawnRadius" and generate again, to expand the world.
This can take a while.

`/mx-ig regenerate`
Removes all existing islands, which are unlooted, and generates them again.
This will remove blocks built on them.
It will do nothing, if the island chest is looted.
This can take a while.

`/mx-ig lookupLoot`
Shows the percentage of chests looted in the world.

`/mx-ig config <key> <value>`
Sets the value of the config file.
possible keys:
- tickBuffer (integer >= 0)
